We hosted our first Startup Office Hours meetup almost two years ago as a means of supporting New York’s vast entrepreneurial community with insights into what it takes to build a successful startup. Our presenters included startup founders in areas like real estate, edtech, social media, brain/bio hacking, software consulting [guess who…]—and even tech veterans like John Pavley, current CTO of Viacom. We’ve had a blast hosting these events, but with time comes change, and we at The Hackerati have decided to use this event to start digging deeper into the tech side of things. Starting in September or October [still working out the details], we’ll be kicking off a new series: NYC Tech Talks with The Hackerati.  Our goal for these NYC Tech Talks is to share the in-depth insights we’ve gained from engineering successful technologies across various industries. We expect to focus on topics including Web/Mobile, Big Data/Analytics/Visualization, Machine Learning, and Distributed [Cloud] Computing with presenters from The Hackerati and other leading NYC Tech companies. We’ll be kicking things off with a presentation by Rob Marano, Cofounder of The Hackerati. He’s planning to show us how to leverage new AWScomponents and Spark to analyze clickstream data for online advertising. More details to come! Bad user testing is exactly like that moment a 2-year-old shows you a cartoon drawing of…well whatever that crayon scribble they’ve worked so hard on represents. Maybe those circles on the bottom are legs—maybe it’s suppose to be a pony. If you can guess what they intended you might give them awesome pony-based feedback about how it looks so life-like! If not, maybe just say how pretty it looks. Give them a gold sticker. Hang it on the fridge. Your coworkers, your friends, even random people off the street will do the same. They’ll lie through their teeth when giving feedback, positive or negative. Consider any of the following motivations: 1. You mean a lot to them, so whatever you give them they’ll tell you it’s awesome. 2. They hate you, and no matter what you give them they’ll tell you it sucks. 3. They pick a small detail that they can critique, just so they can say enough words to not make the conversation awkward. 4. They actually use a totally different operating system, and lied about their habits so they can get paid. 5. Maybe they are telling you things as they are, but not how they should be. [http://xkcd.com/688/] You’ll find a couple of awesome people who can give you the appropriate amount of tough love—like your boss, if you’re lucky. But how do you get a statistical representation of your user base for those tricky nuanced questions? What if your target audience is teenagers and not an assortment of designers, developers, and project managers? Just like good design is invisible, good feedback is mostly unconscious. Put your app in the user’s hands and watch what they tap. Ask them to find the latest content and look at which buttons they press. Maybe they totally ignore certain menus, or have to double-back in an awkward way because they got lost somewhere. Even worse, maybe they give up on finding something because it’s not in an obvious location. For a more concrete example, maybe you’re concerned about the loading speed on a certain piece of content. One solution might be to set up timers and run studies about how many milliseconds are too long. Or maybe ask the user if it felt responsive. Whether they would wait that long. If they would open the app weekly. The better way would be to go up to a random stranger, ask them to explore your new app, and see if they press the cancel button or start to hand you back the phone before the content loads. Try to have the least attractive person in your office do it and see if they still stick around. To quote the entirety of one of my favorite app store reviews, “Cool.”  With luck on your side and about 30 iterations of the above, maybe you too can achieve such stellar results. Vivian KeatingCreative Technologist 1 note The Hackerati continues to build out its leadership team with industry veterans, proudly adding Amanda Keleher as Chief People Officer. She’s extremely seasoned, having held multiple senior People roles at IT consulting companies, including Global Head of People at ThoughtWorks. She then relocated to New York to join Intent Media as their VP of People. As a people company, The Hackerati relies heavily on social contracts and nontraditional approaches to foster an enjoyable, creative, innovative culture. Our culture has been focused on transparency, authenticity, and having a helluva lot of fun from Day One.  As Chief People Officer, Amanda will lead and continue to develop our unique culture, with a focus on diversity and innovation. She’s also working on some exciting initiatives to collaborate with other NYC Tech companies and the tech community in general. The Hackerati attracts and retains top engineers by offering a work environment that doesn’t really feel like work. With a blossoming startup accelerator [Hackerati Labs] as our core side project, there’s plenty of room for personal and team growth. And at the absolute forefront of everything we do is the motto Be Fearless. We understand that innovation isn’t a product of following the crowd, and we do our best to promote and celebrate differences. Catering to all of our team’s diverse interests—from hacking to music to breakdancing to learning languages to poetry—is a core internal focus, and this is why having Amanda Keleher on board as Chief People Officer is a huge step forward for us. Though early in her journey as a Hackerata, Amanda has already provided a powerful burst of perspective and energy. We all feel fortunate to work with such a force, and are sure to look back on this event and see it as an overwhelmingly positive turning point. Welcome aboard, Amanda. Onward and upward! Become your favorite actor or your crush’s fantasy and send them a pic! Clone the repo or get the first Beta release and try it out for yourself! The app is built on a framework call openFrameworks. It’s a C++ framework designed for creative coding, so you can develop really awesome and visually intriguing apps, and with all of the addons available the possibilities are endless. The app is also based on our very own Grace Avery’s OS X app as featured in a previous blog post which achieves the same result, just on Macs. Building the app posed a couple of problems. The first and most apparent “problem” is that openFrameworks libraries are written in C++ and iOS apps are, primarily still, writted in Objective-C. Luckily, there’s a way to combat the issue via Objective-C++. Essentially, the app is written both in Objective-C and C++ with both syntaxes mixed in to a single file in some cases. There’s some meddling around in the Build Settings required to get the app to compile correctly at first since you’ll get a bunch of type reference errors unless you use C++99 for the language dialect and libstdc++ standard library as oppose to the libc++ standard library. Secondly, ARC, or Automatic Reference Counting, isn’t a thing in the app. Garbage collection is all handled manually just like in the good ol’ days, so the app is sorta primitive in that sense. And also pointers. Pointers everywhere! They aren’t so much problems as they are a nuisance. So enough with the nitty gritty… how does the app work? You can look at the video as 2 layers. The first (bottom) layer is what the camera is capturing (a.k.a. your face) and the second layer (top) is the face you have chosen to become. If you just slap the image you want on top of the bottom layer, it’ll be like plastering a poster onto your face, so we need a way to “cut” the face out of that poster. If we break that process up, we first need to actually find a face. That’s all handled through a Face Detection library, ofxFaceTracker, and a Computer Vision library,ofxOpenCV. The image (whatever face you chose) is converted into a matrix via ofxOpenCV and that matrix is fed into an ofxFaceTrackerinstance. Once we get that tracker set up we can get the image points of the face. This will allow us to create the mesh that will be our cut out face. For those interested in the code, here it is: The same thing is done for your face on the bottom layer. For video face detection, we use the ofxFaceTrackerThreaded library to conduct calculations asynchronously to better performance and not bog down the system. The reason for using the threaded face tracker to get the points of your face on camera is that those points are constantly recalculated and found again almost every new frame of the video (sorry, can’t help dropped frames), so performing these operations asynchronously is crucial. What you’re left with is two sets of face points that can be converted into a mesh. Each set of points represents a face whether it be your face or the selected face. The points in each mesh can be mapped to each other 1-1, so essentially it’s like taking a rubber mask and stretching it to cover your face while keeping the major features as close together as possible (in this case, the eyes, eyebrows, node, and mouth are the places with the highest resolution or most points). Once those points are glued to each other, the points on the top layer are completely controlled by the points generated by your face. That’s why when you open your mouth or move your eyebrows the top face also follows them. The resulting mesh looks like this when mapped onto your face:  If you’re really interested in the nitty gritty code of the app, I definitely recommend cloning the repo or downloading the first beta release code. Everything regarding the processing of the face image and the camera face is found in the ofApp.cpp file in the Application group. Remember, you need to have downloaded openFrameworks along with the necessary addons (ofxOpenCV, ofxCV, and ofxFaceTracker) and then throw the code three levels below the root of the openFrameworks directory (it’s easiest to put the app folder in openFrameworks/apps/myApps/. That’ll ensure all of the OF libraries are found and that the project runs correctly. Also, another thing to note is that this project will only run on physical devices because of the use of the front facing camera. You’ll get unknown architecture errors if you try to use the simulator. Lastly, face swap responsibly and have fun! Startup Office Hours is The Hackerati’s way of promoting the early-stage startup world and sharing experiences to help founders along in their journeys. The Hackerati has entrepreneurship at its core: our founders Geoff Scott and Rob Marano have been involved in a total of eight startups, and our nascent Hackerati Labs incubator seeks to fund startups conceived by the entrepreneurial engineers on our team. It became obvious that we should be directly involved with this growing community of risk-takers with transformative ideas, and so Startup Office Hours was born. What began as a group of about 25 people in a classroom at NYIT has grown to over 1200 members with events being held at various startup spaces around New York—and even once at Viacom. It’s been awesome to watch this community grow and to garner feedback from people across the entrepreneurial spectrum, from the early-stage founders still figuring out their ideas to the seasoned veterans and VCs. Our goal from the beginning was to keep things casual while still offering valuable advice and sparking meaningful discussions. We believe we’ve succeeded, and we thankfully applaud our members—whether they’ve come just once or every month—and all of our impressive presenters. Here’s to the continued success of another dedicated NYC community! If you’d like to present your startup at a future event or host us at your venue, please email me. We hope you’ll join us at our upcoming events! Here are a few highlights from past events:John Pavley [currently SVP of Engineering at Viacom]We met at a gorgeous Viacom event space, where John Pavley shared his experience from working with Apple, DoubleClick, Yahoo!, LimeWire, Spotify, Huffington Post, and Viacom. Pavley is also an Adjunct Instructor at NYU. Check out his brilliant talk on Taboo-Driven Innovation. OpenBCIAn artist and self-taught Electrical Engineer taught a class at Parsons, where one of his students built a brain-monitoring baseball hat. They broke off to fund OpenBCI [BCI = Brain Computer Interface] via Kickstarter and raised $215,000 in their quest for $100k. This was an awesome talk with an even cooler demo! SchoologyThis onsite event—i.e. one where Schoology both hosted and presented—was incredibly insightful, as Schoology has done an incredible job scaling a project that began in a college course to support over 7 million users in all 50 states and more than 150 countries. Casting to the PeopleWe gathered again in the gorgeous loft on Bowery that Casting to the People uses as their office—this time to hear about their startup: a mobile auditioning app that lets applicants vote up top submissions, allowing the most talented actors to be discovered—regardless of their connections. The Hackerati is proud to announce Jim Scott as Chief Operating Officer. Jim has been in the industry for over 20 years—a seasoned executive with both Fortune 100 and startup experience. His expertise in corporate and business development, marketing, product development, and financial management with a deep information technology background leave him perfectly equipped to help grow this entrepreneurial engineering team. We’re ecstatic to have such a competent leader join our team. Prior to joining The Hackerati, Jim was the President of SimplyEngage, a SaaS company focused on providing multi-unit brands with the tools and and data insight to engage customers locally. Prior to SimplyEngage, Jim was the Chief Operating Officer of PerformLine (an affiliate marketing and services firm), Automated Resources Group (a marketing services firm focusing on subscriber membership and audience management) and Donnelley Marketing (an infoGroup company) where he was responsible for operating income objectives as well as all aspects of solution delivery services, account management services, data processing services, vendor management, and production services. Prior to Donnelley Marketing, Jim was the Founder and CEO of ResponseLogic, a personalization software and services firm enabling marketers to target web and email content based on a proprietary recommendation engine. Bringing on Jim as COO is a big step forward in scaling The Hackerati. We’ve been around for almost three years, and most of our growth has been on the engineering side. Jim’s expertise in direct marketing will be pivotal in further expanding our clientele, which will in turn allow us to continue hiring brilliant, creative engineers. I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Jim since he began and he’s been tremendously helpful in providing a structured approach to marketing. He’s also helping push Labs forward on the organizational side, including an overview on what it takes to raise capital at our March Pitch Day. This is just the beginning of The Hackerati’s internal growth. I’ve been here since January 2013 when the team was about six months old and it’s been awesome to track our progress. There ain’t nothin’ as exciting as building out a startup! The Hackerati recently launched its first seminar—An Agile Approach to Big Data—through its blossoming Academy. Hackerati Academy has been an idea since our inception and we’re incredibly excited to be expanding the offering. We’ve run several pilot courses in areas like Android, Javascript, and Scala at Cooper Union, NYU Poly, and NYIT. We’ve also used Hackerati Academy as a means of growing our internal capabilities by having periodic Academy sessions during team lunch on Fridays. And now, with the introduction of this seminar, we’re excited to broaden the Academy’s scope and exposure. An Agile Approach to Big Data debuted on Monday, March 2nd at Turn To Tech. Our goal was to introduce software engineers comfortable in Python and databases to Big Data practices and Agile software development. With support from Amazon Web Services—who offered a $50 AWS credit to all attendees—and BigML, The Hackerati had a blast providing this high-level perspective on practical techniques to talented software engineers. Hackerati cofounder Rob Marano kicked off the seminar, while Python/Big Data engineers Ethan Lusterman and Derek Toub walked the group through the details. After a lecture overview, these three Hackerati engineers—as well as one from Amazon—gave hands-on advice during a breakout session. We know that the best way to learn is to dive headfirst into problems, so this is the way we teach. We’re hosting this event again on Tuesday, March 31st for Cooper Union’s electrical engineering students, and plan to bring it elsewhere in the coming months. We’re also in the process of putting together seminars on some other topics. Keep an ear out for future events if you want to pick up some new skills with Hackerati Academy! If you’d like to keep abreast of upcoming Academy (and other) events, join our newsletter by filling out the form on the right side of our footer. Inquire here if you’re interested in ramping up your employees’ skillsets with a Hackerati Academy training course. And, as always—in work, education, and play—be fearless! The Hackerati was invited back to the United Nations for another presentation to promote Humanicy: The Human Side of Diplomacy. Check out my post on Humanicy’s April 4th media launch event for details on the platform. December 4th and 5th marked the first full-fledged Humanicy event: a two-day celebration of art and its ability to help us recognize that we are all human beings connected through love and expression. Ambassador Toriello has promoted this idea at the UN because of inherent diplomatic and political buffers between this core human instinct to express and love. As I wrote in my other post, “[Toriello] sees art as the foundation of the human experience, and believes that diplomats and politicians who see each other as fellow human beings before discussing politics are more likely to establish meaningful connections.” Once again, a question may be quite appropriately raised: how does this involve The Hackerati? The two-day Humanicy event featured discussions, presentations, and performances highlighting the importance of art, including musicians—like Peter Yarrow from Peter, Paul, and Mary and a Juilliard/Columbia string ensemble—a cartoonist, photographers, painters, a documentarian…the list goes on. Yet there was no focus on the technology driving each of these art forms—at least not until our presentation. As Creative Technologists—professional engineers who weave their artistic pursuits into their work—The Hackerati teamed up with a few members of Local Projects to illuminate the age-old confluence of science and art. In fact, the word technology comes from two Greek roots: techne, meaning art or craft, and logia, meaning science or study. Everything is technology; everything is a blend of science and art. I did my best to convey this sentiment in my introduction through my primary method of expression: spoken word poetry. Grace followed with insight into technology’s influence on heightened empathy. Using open-source facial recognition software, she suggested we would better understand others if we could see oursleves as them. She took on the face of the Mona Lisa,  the Dalai Lama,  and even Ambassador Toriello! Andreas Borg of Local Projects rounded off by using the same software to highlight this empathic response on a global political level, translating facial expressions into sound and asking us to perceive ostensibly cacophonous interactions as orchestrated music.  You can view our presentation here, starting at 1:45:40. To further emphasize the inseparability of science and art, The Hackerati Band—which first came together at our Holiday Party last year—played its first official set the night before, following the Juilliard/Columbia string ensemble. The band consisted of Derby [Vocals and Percussion], Grace Avery [Piano], and Omar Niazi [Trumpet] of The Hackerati, Andreas Borg [Guitar] of Local Projects, and supporting musicians Karen Larson [Violin], Jose Moura [Bass Guitar], and Sebastian Guerrero [Cajón]. While this portion of the Thursday event isn’t on UN Web TV, we’ve posted two songs on our Youtube Channel. Mi Vida was written by Derby and Andreas, and the unofficially titled Grace’s Song was written by Derby and Grace. We’d like to once again thank Ambassador Toriello and the Friendship Ambassadors Foundation for hosting Humanicy and inviting us along to share our perspective. Though The Hackerati is an engineering startup, we celebrate our team’s ability to use these tools to better express ourselves and look forward with great anticipation to further highlight the eternal bond between knowledge and expression. The Browser and JavaScripts = SUCH WOW, SO AMAZE!!11!! In response to:  I completely disagree with you, Alex. I believe that browsers are the future of application development, especially when it comes to mobile. When mobile devices first came out, the general strategy was to be the first app in the marketplace to be competitive. But the strategy has shifted to differentiating an app with better performance and UI, which is mainly achieved through native libraries. In the near future, users will increasingly own heterogeneous devices across a range of manufacturers, with wearables and other connected devices entering the mix. Users have come to expect a seamless app experience across all of these devices and continuous updates throughout the lifetime of the app. The only way to deliver this at the speed of today’s trends and stay competitive by covering all of these devices is to use a web-based strategy by leveraging existing browser technologies into applications. Browsers were originally designed for delivering static HTML pages, but I believe we are seeing a round of new thinking towards browsers running modern applications. While most browsers have traditionally been CPU-intensive, frameworks and technologies are tackling app performance by taking advantage of GPUs for UI (see WebGL and Famo.us) and rethinking how DOM manipulations occur (see react). Below are some links to applications being built on browsers: https://www.mobilespan.com/content/chrome-is-the-new-c-runtime https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit https://atom.io/ (Built on top of webkit; takes advantage of JavaScript/CSS/HTML for extensibility/plugins) As for JavaScript, I really can’t imagine a more exciting language right now. Whole operating systems are being developed to run exclusively HTML5/CSS/Javascript apps (Firefox Mobile OS, ChromeOS). It’s easy enough to get started for beginners, and now that you can build more than just web frontends, it has really taken open source to the next level with the average layman releasing a new library every week. The depth of the language is now evident with its prominence in the reactive/asynchronous programming and functional programming movements. The fact that you can run JavaScript code written by a stranger without having to install it or care too much about security is unique, along with its ubiquity in terms of developer talent and its ability to run on any platform with low overhead. Even if you don’t like the particulars of the language, you can take still take advantage by leveraging projects like Emscripten to compile your favorite language into JS bytecode. Below are some impressive examples of what the future of JavaScript might hold: http://vps2.etotheipiplusone.com:30176/redmine/projects/emscripten-qt/wiki/Demos: Qt GUI framework running in your browser http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/GUI/: SQLite Database in your browser http://www.quakejs.com/: Quake 3 running in your browser http://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki: More examples of projects converted to JS http://bellard.org/jslinux/: Linux OS in your browser (not Emscripten—straight JS implementation) Post written by former Hackeratus Eddy Garcia. Half (mostly) kidding, but: JavaScript shouldn’t be a language, web browsers suck, and are all of those MOOCs making money hand over fist really adding value to our community? A TechCrunch article highlighting the importance of software entrepreneurs having mobile development chops was shared in our Labs email forum the other day, and it was consistent with some thoughts I’ve been having. I recently mentioned in the office that web browsers should vanish into obscurity, JavaScript shouldn’t exist as a viable option for real programming, and the internet should be reduced to only shuttling data back and forth between servers and clients or clients and clients—as long as the clients aren’t web browsers. Mobile web is what drove my point even more. As much as I don’t want it to be true, as I mature as a programmer I continually see JavaScript as a pretty awful language for real programming. Yes, obviously it is of monumental importance due to the status quo of how we ingest things on the internet, not to mention that 80% of my job is writing JavaScript—but maybe Apple is right. Maybe an ecosystem of sandboxed apps that run natively on your device and serve one or two specific purposes is a good way of doing things. That’s not to say we should all have Apple computers and Apple apps. On the contrary, Geoff brought up the potential disaster of a commercial entity having veto power over any and all apps that try to surface. But if we as technologists decided to go down that avenue, maybe something like a W3 or an IETF could oversee which apps get to live and which deserve to die. Now, contrary to my argument, I think there would be a pretty big blow to technology education (for-profit MOOCs would be FUBAR in the short term); and I have learned a metric ton about the Internet from right click > view source. That said, how much value is the community getting from for-profit MOOCs and view source anyway? This is, to say the least, tangential to the original point, but why are we so worried about everyone in the world becoming competent coders? Not everyone in the world is a competent lawyer or physician. Judging from the data we get from companies like Coursera, I think the result of these websites is that a handful of people become really good programmers (like Alex Krupp), and a lot of people sign up for courses and never finish them. The Alex Krupps of the world would have learned either way, given enough book-learnin’ time. Disagree? See the response post In Defense of Browsers.
Last week a few members of The Hackerati attended Y Combinator Startup School at the Best Buy Theater in Times Square, NYC. The event is an expo of Y Combinator companies, venture capitalist presenters, and their success stories and advice. Over 1000 people made their way out to what is usually a concert hall to listen to the likes of Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures and rising YC companies such as Instacart. If you'd like to watch the livestream recording you can find it here, with a segmented youtube playlist here.
   This post summarizes each presentation and the takeaways that entrepreneurs would want to hear from them. If you want to read about a particular speaker choose from the following list: Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, kicked off the event with a bit of history on YC Startup School. Startup School started as a small meeting between founders to share ideas and learn from each other how to be successful in building a technology company. “It's important for people to come out to Startup School to be around people who are doing things.” He told all the people who just talk about doing something innovative and new to “stay home.” And he reminded us that it's easy to get started: “You don't have to open a factory - you just have to open a laptop.” Ohanian is a dynamic moderator with a relaxed stage presence and serious charisma. He appealed to the rising tech community in New York by polling the audience to find out how far they'd come and from what boroughs/cities/states. The largest (read: loudest) contingencies of attendees were from Queens and Brooklyn, where the New York Tech community has an increasing presence. I personally came across founders from the likes of Philadelphia and Boston, and as far away as Missouri. The first speaker of the series was one of the most topically interesting. Each speaker shared the things that they had learned during their experience working in startups, but Shana Fisher from Highline VP addressed her talk to opinions that are the opposite advice of what you usually hear. The following list summarizes the thought-provoking takeaways. Shana Fisher  -  Unconventional Opinions for Startups a) Runway: Don't think about the time that your money gives you (i.e. your “runway”). Instead, make it last as long as you can; bootstrap and be creative to get things like free space, free food, and free employment. b) Founders: Common knowledge says that you need multiple cofounders to be successful. Shana believes that single founders can be just as successful when their personality dictates and has invested in many single founders. c) Time to Launch: Launching quickly with plans to improve a half-baked product is no longer the path to success. One needs to perfect products before release to general public because the marketplace is too crowded and noisy for a bad product to gain traction. d) Location: New York is good for early-stage startups, though they need roots in SF community. San Francisco still has better infrastructure for middle-stage startups. e) Investors: William Goldman once said “Nobody knows anything.” Don't always trust investors when they tell you something about your business. Sometimes investors have too many deals going on and aren't in the headspace to properly evaluate your deal. Shana followed up with, “I don't believe in patterns,” and many investors are used to using patterns to make judgements about businesses. Each case needs to be evaluated individually as well. f) Product Development: Plan for today and don't always think too much about scaling in the future. Your focus as a business is to build a product your users can pay you for or make use of TODAY. Additionally, product design is plateauing as investors see flat, simple design as the only option for good design. You should think about design breakthroughs. Copying Apple and other top products raises the risk of getting lost in the crowd. g) People: People are the most important asset for every company so take care to be a good manager. Many entrepreneurs have little management experience and should learn one by one as they hire employees. Don't hire a new employee until you've learned how to manage the last employee. Also, hire different perspectives: men, women, people from New York and people from abroad. Don't forget to be mindful of “can I talk to you for a minute” conversations. Take care of what your employees need and don't hire unless you understand or have the ability to manage each employee. Otherwise things will go wrong. h) Equinox: There is a line between when you don't have to make money and when you do called the equinox. Think about your business model and understand when you're past the equinox and NEED to make money before things begin to unravel. i) Cosmos: Dream of building something that can reach the end of the universe. Grand ideas for changing the world are what make startups great and lead to success when executed with passion and vision. Shana Fisher spoke very conversationally and stressed that these are just her opinions based on her experience funding startups. Her presentation was particularly well designed by an artist, with each slide containing the topic word or phrase and a beautiful graphic. She also chided the audience to not write about what she said. Whoops. Fred Wilson  -  Attitudes Towards Investing Next to the stage was the eminent VC Fred Wilson, revered Union Square Ventures investor. The format of his presentation was an interview with one of the YC partners. They lounged in comfy chairs and went back and forth discussing the status of New York entrepreneurship and his beliefs on what makes a successful startup. Fred opened up about what he looks for when evaluating a pitch. “It's important for investors to have conviction.” They need to come to a meeting ready to evaluate the pitch with an open mind. However, he admitted that he often enters meetings with preconceived notions about what is interesting to him. Fred recalled discussing a “google for jobs” idea with a colleague several years back, wherein one could just search for the job they wanted and receive accurate listings. When the founders of indeed.com crossed his desk, he jumped at the opportunity because this was that thing he'd been talking about! One of the highlights of the back and forth was when the YC Partner casually mentioned how Fred passed up the opportunity to invest in Airbnb. Fred pointed at his back and responded with “I've got an open wound right here, you want to pour more salt in it?” He also discussed another failed investment - Turntable.fm - where he invested because he knew the entrepreneurs well. There was a lot of churn in the business, but Fred admitted that he overlooked some metrics because of how hot the growth was and how much he admired the team. You need to bet on the entrepreneur. Fred then described the flight of stairs that it takes to build a business, which you can find in detail on his blog. He said that many of the entrepreneurs he meets start off strong but, after making the initial round of funding, don't put their heads down and build a business. An entrepreneur needs to be an expert watchdog for every aspect of his business - accounting, operations, fundraising, product development, marketing - or needs to be willing to find the right people to fill each need. In his final comment, Fred discussed the geography question that Shana had touched on in her presentation. SaaS and consumer businesses are both thriving in NYC and one big advantage is that there is SO MUCH CAPITAL. It's a seller's market for entrepreneurs and a great time to start a company. Fred closed by discussing the tech scenes around the world, including Israel, which he said has a 30+ year-old startup scene that is stronger than ever. Israel has always been a powerhouse for startups (see: Start-up Nationthe book.), and though in 2008 they took a bit longer than San Francisco and NYC to transition into the current model, they are now doing incredibly well. Fred's talk was one of my favorites for the night because it included so many pieces of advice that were delivered concisely and with awesome anecdotes to back them up. Zach Sims  -  Codecademy Zach Sims was probably the most relatable speaker of the night. As the cofounder
of Codecademy, he had an audience full of entrepreneurs and budding coders
gratefully and attentively hanging on to every word of his founding story. For those who aren't aware, Codecademy is a web platform that teaches people to code in a number of programming languages through in-browser command line challenges. Zach's story is a Y Combinator legend. A mere few weeks before demo day, he and his partner, Ryan Bubinski, weren't even sure what company/product they were building. The YC partners and other advisors had all but given up hope and told them to make sure that whatever they presented should be embarrassing - but not super embarrassing. After running through a number of crazy ideas, including a CRM for club promoters (which Zach fondly described as one of the worst ideas ever), they settled on a product that allowed Zach, the non-technical founder, to become a proficient programmer during his time at YC. Codecademy was released two weeks before demo day and instantly skyrocketed in the rankings as formerly frustrated programming students clamored to get more from the team. They were overjoyed to be able to finally learn to build something with code. The growth and turnaround surprised everyone, including Zach and Ryan. Zach and Ryan were eventually funded for 2.5 million dollars by Union Square Ventures. One of my favorite moments was when Zach showed his ATM receipt after taking out $60 and the balance was around $2,499,940. Zach's presentation was super down to earth and incorporated real-life pictures from his experience. This made his lessons all the more impactful. There were a number of lessons incorporated into the presentation, but the main idea Zach shared was simple and powerful: Don't make the mistake of building a product just to build a product. Zach wanted to learn to code more easily, and he and Ryan built something for Zach to learn to code. Build a product to solve one of your problems. Thank you, Zach and Ryan, from the tech community at large, for bringing programming to the world. Kathryn Minshew  -  The Muse Kathryn Minshew is the founder of the Muse, a career content site for professional women. This YC alum told her story and the lessons she learned from starting her business. To summarize her points: Kathryn gave her tips on hiring, including advice to hire from the “deadpool,” i.e. ex-employees of failed or failing startups. She talked about “lurking” on Hacker News and TechCrunch to see when companies have issues or are leaking employees. When Grooveshark was hit by a lawsuit, she stalked LinkedIn and job boards to see if anyone was looking for work. Kathryn talked very quickly but carried herself with poise. Her talk may have been riddled with expletives, but her frankness served to add to her honesty and credibility. Apoorva Mehta  -  Instacart Instacart is an app for grocery shopping that delivers groceries to your door. You select the products you want from select grocery stores in your area, and a personal shopper purchases and delivers them within two hours. Instacart is a recent phenomenon that takes shopping for groceries to the Internet. Apoorva Mehta left his job at Amazon in Seattle for San Francisco to start a company. Along the way, he and his partner prototyped dozens of ideas before settling on solving a problem they faced - the horror of shopping for groceries. They eventually got into YC and worked to build their user base by having everyone at YC use their service. Apoorva recounted a number of amusing stories, including the time when YC used his service to order 200 bottles of soda; his shopper was unable to make the delivery herself and called him crying. He personally went over to help her load the bottles into her car to make a delivery. Upon delivery, he received a grateful reply from Renee, the dinner coordinator: “This was so convenient, I'm going to do this every week!” There's great irony in Apoorva solving the problem of grocery shopping by buying extreme amounts of groceries. Lessons:
a) Keep trying until you find the right idea; solve a problem that matters to you
b) Worry about scalability later; bootstrap your ideas and solve problems with what you have until you require something better David Lee - SV Angel David Lee is an accomplished investing partner at SV Angel. His talk centered on lessons he learned from Ron Conway, who has over 20 years of experience investing in startups. He opened with the story of personal inspiration: His father invented a device that automated the manufacture of fortune cookies, and so lived the life of a startup founder, with all of the ups and downs associated with a running one's own business. His slide deck came straight from a document that SV Angel uses to guide its decision making process to invest in companies.   The driving force behind an investment decision is “chemistry with founders.” If they like the founder and they like the industry, they're likely to invest. A good founder has: “A good elevator pitch. Keep it simple.”
David's opinion is that the single most important skill a founder can have is the ability to express their vision to customers, employees, and investors. “Good listeners. Strong willed but flexible.”
A founder should be able to listen to all advice/data, process it, and make the right decision. A founder needs to be flexible but also able to ignore the wrong advice. A focus on “Value Add”
He doesn't look at an investor just based on price but also based on what the investor can offer. “Never forget, your reputation is your biggest asset.”
David advises building a strong reputation for things like: Very important advice for founders to keep in mind. Chase Adam  -  Watsi: A nonprofit YC venture The closing act of the event was an inspirational talk by Chase Adam about founding Watsi: a crowdfunding platform that raises money to cover medical bills for people in impoverished nations without healthcare. Chase described his experience as the first YC nonprofit. His founding experience was born when returning to San Francisco after a couple of years in the Peace Corps. While he expected his friends back home to be relatively miserable in their nine-to-fives, he instead returned to find that they were thriving at startups, innovating to change the world. Chase was inspired to found his company and convinced his team to work as volunteers to build the initial site. He described the difficulties in finding a developer to build the product and also described the incredible effort that went into generating votes for a HuffPost-sponsored startup competition. He swore that he would never do an online voting competition again because it was “one of the most stressful weeks of [his] life.” To take the lead in the competition, one of his employees convinced a bouncer to make people vote before entering the bar. Awesome creativity and drive. Some important lessons for startups he shared included: Chase was an inspirational closing act because he showed how radical startups can drastically improve social welfare. Closing Thoughts People stayed well past 10:00PM to talk startups and embody the philosophy of the event. They shared the experience and dream of DOING, innovating, and creating positive change through technology. I highly recommend Startup School to anyone who feels they gained insight from this article. Hackerati cofounder Rob Marano had some interesting opportunities as a purveyor of technical wisdom over the past couple of weeks. With over twenty years of experience in the industry - from building rockets and satellites with GE Aerospace to founding his own tech startups - Rob has deep insights into running businesses and architecting the technologies that support them. On Wednesday, June 4th, Rob spoke at a Northside Innovation event hosted at a temporary Dell Venue in Soho. Northside collaborated with Dell on numerous events at this space throughout their four-week residency, and Rob was looped into their Big Data discussion. He was on a panel beside Michael Lewis [Creative Director of Data Visualization at R/GA] and Liv Buli [Data Journalist at Next Big Sound], with moderator Justin Hendrix [Executive Director of NYC Media Lab]. It was great to hear Rob speak in depth about a topic that I can typically only appreciate from his high-level comments like, “I'm seriously jammed on this Hadoop project!” The details of what he's actually doing to build out what he calls “Big Data plumbing” are really interesting. This is the kind of technology that's going to allow my dreams of a truly quantified self come to fruition. As a writer, I'm constantly thinking about how my everyday speech could be recorded, converted to searchable text, run through natural language processing and sentiment analysis algorithms, and then processed via machine learning to give me feedback on what I'm saying, what factors contribute to what I say, how I can speak more effectively, etc. And this will ultimately lead to a complete reimagination of the writing process. All of the answers are in the data. It's up to us to discover them. Rob's candid discussion of this is illuminating: “Information that exists [in a database] may not come from a particular transaction that you care about. It's gonna come from the things that go around the transaction: How long is that transaction? Where'd they do it from? What was the demographic of that person who just did that transaction? Were they driving a CitiBike? Were they driving a car? Were they on I-95? By answering the who/what/where/when/how, we can answer the why with analytics. Answering the first questions helps you acquire and sort the data, and answering the why helps you monetize that data.” You can see a video of this talk here. [Recorded by yours truly via Google Glass - please excuse any chatter and laughter!] The following morning, Rob was interviewed by Shraysi Tandon of China Central Television [CCTV]. CCTV is the world's largest broadcaster, with 1.3 billion viewers across 80 countries - 40 million in the United States alone! Safe to say, this was a pretty big opportunity! Shraysi has interviewed greats like Noam Chomsky and Steve Wozniak, and she reached out to Rob for his perspective on the importance of cyber security roles in America. With the increasing presence of hackers [i.e. crackers, or cyber security hackers], cyber security jobs in both the federal government and the private sector are on the rise as security threats increase. This is very much in line with the rise of security breaches in major corporations like Facebook, eBay, and Evernote, as well as the government, such as thetheft of F-35 fighter jet plans. As we continue to rely on digital technology in all aspects of life and business, more and more of ourselves become susceptible to such attacks. The only true response is to ensure that we have knowledgeable leaders guarding the helm. “I think [having a chief information security officer is] as important as having a chief financial officer. And the reason being that anyone's business is run on technology today. Try to name one business that doesn't touch technology. I bet...you can't even say a mom and pop shop anymore. It's everything. It's infiltrated our entire life. Just like the concept of money. It's part of our daily lives in anything and everything we do. Technology is the same. So we should give it its own seat at the table where the largest and most important decisions are made and that's in the board room. And it's starting to happen.” Check out the video here. Rob comes in at 1:53. Derby and I checked out Dev Bootcamp's first NYC graduate presentations last week, and we were seriously impressed by the graduates, the teachers, the space, and the core philosophy. Wall Street had better ready itself for a transformation! Disclaimer: I'm hooked on the DBC Kool-Aid. I wasn't asked by anyone in the organization to write about their program - I'm promoting their awesomeness because I feel people should know about this. Dev Bootcamp was founded in San Francisco in early 2012 with the mission to enable people to “make beautiful and meaningful things” by teaching a practical, hands-on course in web development. The school has since moved eastward to NYC, setting up camp in Chicago along the way. Surprisingly, the core of DBC's curriculum isn't just about imparting technical ability, but also philosophy - an understanding of the self, the other, and the world that we all share. Though technical knowledge is taught from Day 1 [and, in fact, earlier, through a remote prep course], DBC also has major focuses on self-awareness and empathy, extending as far as mandatory yoga for the first three weeks. From a blog post on the subject: [Yoga] is a reminder for people to be mindful. It is a reminder that their body isn't just a vessel for their brains. It is a reminder, more than anything, that the point of acquiring these new skills isn't just to get a new job but to build a new, complete life. Dev Bootcamp isn't just about teaching people how to create with technology. It's a platform for personal and, more importantly, interpersonal development to help shape our society into one that understands its people, its technologies, and the intimate connections between the two. Derby and I met DBC NYC Director Lloyd Nimetz for lunch several weeks ago after being introduced by a mutual contact, and I was blown away when he filled us in on their philosophical approach. It was obvious to me that this is the future of teaching programming - and everything. One of the issues I had with my own education - from K–12 through my undergraduate engineering program - was that it was mostly information-based. But there are universal principles of life that enable us to see connections between diverse fields of knowledge, and to ultimately connect this knowledge to ourselves. It's one thing to say, “This is a tool, this is how it works, this is how you use it.” It's infinitely more comprehensible and powerful to say, ”You are a tool and this is how you work. That is a tool that you don't yet have and this is how it works. Finally, this is how your unique toolkit can best interface with that tool.” That last bit of understanding must ultimately take place within the individual, and a strong philosophical foundation is the most effective catalyst. A tool is useless without an informed operator, and is potentially dangerous without an understanding of its relation to society. DBC's acknowledgement of this idea allows them to stand out from other learn to code quickly courses/bootcamps. They're the real deal, and I was stoked to get involved. Attending their first NYC presentation was a great way to get started. DBC NYC's premier cohort, the Fiddler Crabs [each cohort is named after an animal], graduated and presented their final projects on Friday, May 30th. The class of 12 was broken into three groups, each of which had their own impressive project to demonstrate: All of the graduates spoke confidently and articulately about their work - a clear indicator that they gained a cohesive skillset throughout the rigorous nine-week course. It was most encouraging to see that they all set out to solve real problems that they've encountered directly. Equipped with new skills and serious dedication to the craft, they built tools to solve them. After the presentations, Derby and I were invited to eat and chat with the graduates. It was great to be able to get to know more about their backgrounds and their unique journeys to and through the bootcamp. It was also a lot of fun to introduce them to Google Glass, which has become quite a common ritual when interacting with new groups. Regardless of their former backgrounds, these DBC grads are now self- and socially-aware technological builders, and I'm comforted by the knowledge that people of this caliber have their hands and heads in the global machine. I'm further comforted by the fact that this is merely the beginning of DBC's residency in NYC - that they'll continue to train and deploy creative hackers driven by a desire to improve our shared world. Widespread technological ability is one of the brightest aspects of our future. In this increasingly digital age, the ability to improve an existing framework from your home or mobile device is incredibly powerful. This is the literacy of a new generation, and DBC is paving the path forward with social and technological awareness. With numerous bootcamps in existence in NYC alone - and more popping up every month - one should take DBC as the standard for an expertly curated, comprehensive curriculum that understands contemporary sapiens and the tools they've built to manipulate information. In the [likely apocryphal, though sentimentally accurate] words of Albert Einstein, “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” Dev Bootcamp is doing its part to ensure that our humanity progresses alongside our ability to craft powerful new tools. The next generation of creators is here. Get ready to ascend the exponential! The Hackerati recently submitted a proposal for an interactive museum project. To augment our written proposal, our videographer-in-residence, Alex Sheehan, put together this highlight reel to demonstrate The Hackerati's UI/UX abilities and prior work with museums. The Highlight Reel shows the following work: Alex Sheehan Eddy Garcia Geoff Scott Rob Marano Enjoy and prepare for more videos and more highlights as The Hackerati continues to be fearless about creating awesomeness! The Hackerati was invited to present at the United Nations on April 4th to explore technological applications for Humanicy: The Human Side of Diplomacy. Google Glass was an obvious focus because of its revolutionary interface, and though the device itself is still in its infancy and certainly hasn't brought about any major technical revolutions just yet, we strongly believe in the transformative power of a hands-free, voice-activated device - especially in conjunction with other technologies. Humanicy is a portmanteau formed by fusing humanity and diplomacy, and was coined by Angelo Toriello - ambassador-at-large for São Tomé and Príncipe - in an effort to bring members of diplomatic and political communities closer together. He sees art as the foundation of the human experience, and believes that diplomats and politicians who see each other as fellow human beings before discussing politics are more likely to establish meaningful connections. To promote these kinds of interactions within the diplomatic community, Toriello created a forum to highlight the power of art in transforming “hatred into compassion; war into peacefulness.” Presentations included a speech by Toriello, an explanation of Ambassadors Sing for Peace by singing-ambassador Simona Miculescu, an overview of the Global Citizenproject, and a performance by the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit, who bring healing humor to nearly 225,000 hospitalized youths every year. There was also a documentary shown after the presentations called Dancing in Jaffa. Jaffa has Israeli and Palestinian populations, and ballroom dancer Pierre Dulaine - who grew up in Jaffa - taught children from both schools to dance. Humanicy was introduced when he paired Israeli and Palestinian students together as dancing partners, effectively muting their cultural differences through the art of dance - of knowing and understanding another human being through movement. The film was fantastic and is highly recommended. an early prototype of Google Glass So - how does does an esoteric face computer like Glass come into play?Toriello is keen on highlighting the union of science and art, seeing technology as an artistic application of science - one that enhances awareness and, ultimately, security. He's particularly interested in wearable electronics, and Google Glass is by far the most intriguing of the bunch. With our limited knowledge of diplomacy and the UN's efforts, we selected two ideas solely related to a hands-free, head-mounted computer like Glass, and two more general ideas: We envisioned diplomats and ambassadors walking around the UN wearing Glass, and thought about how useful it would be for them to be able to send personal information to each other's units. By opting into the system and sharing information about oneself beyond the political systems and ideals they represent, diplomats can be informed of each other and have more meaningful interactions. The application would allow users to create profiles to provide information such as position, amount of time in that position, political interests, personal interests, hobbies, etc. When the user's smartphone noticed another Glass unit's unique bluetooth ID, it would alert the user through their own Glass and allow them to retrieve that information seamlessly. We then focused on refugee camps and disaster relief centers. Displaced populations seek refuge across the globe, and devices that enhance their user's abilities are ideal for saving lives and enhancing quality of life during such difficult times. Imagine needing medical aid in a camp that has a shortage of medical professionals. True emergencies could be dealt with by establishing a video relay between a field worker and a central medical staff, walking volunteers through diagnoses and remedies. The awesome part is that video chats launched as standard Glassware, so minimal effort would be required to implement such a system. The goal is to send text messages where there's no cellular infrastructure, which seems impossible at first look. But recognizing that every smartphone - and many traditional cellphones - are bluetooth-enabled leads to the realization that there is always a network through which information can travel. By leveraging this ever-present network, refugee camps and disaster relief centers will be able to send messages to each other, allowing for faster response times to emergencies, sending information about delayed food trucks, reuniting separated families, and whatever other problems are hampered by a lack of telecommunication. The best part is that none of these messages would cost any money to send. While text messages are relatively inexpensive for first-worlders, every penny counts when considering displaced third-world families. And if messages need to be sent greater distances from users outside of the range of cell towers, they can piggyback off of others in the network to enter the proximity and have that user send out the message. We understand separated families to be a major issue within refugee camps, so we applied Google's recently-publicized Project Tango to this environment and imagined the ability to provide 3D maps of camps by simply walking around the camp holding a special Tango smartphone. The device has multiple cameras and vision processors that enable it to sense depth just like the human brain. It would be amazing for a lost child to be reunited with their family by asking volunteers to search the database of last-known locations via Glass and then being provided with 3D directions to that location with information collected from Tango. The April 4th event was only a media launch event to announce the official Humanicy forum that will take place in December. We're gearing up for another presentation and some awesome project work that we look forward to unveiling when the time is right.  We'd like to heartily thank Mr. Ambassador Toriello for his invitation to join him in promoting Humanicy, the Friendship Ambassadors Foundation for sponsoring the event, and the United Nations for offering a platform for such powerful modes of expression. This is an exciting time in the technological world, and it will only lead to more excitement, creativity, equality, and Humanicy in the world at large. Check out the video we made to demonstrate these Glass apps and a recording of the presentation on UN Web TV (beginning at 1:05:45). When we first contemplated starting a business together in early 2012, we came up with a diverse list of new product ideas that we could potentially pursue, including software, hardware, security, media, mobile, analytics, and more. Then a funny thing happened: we liked several of them, but we couldn't choose just one! We figured that investors probably wouldn't fund a product company that was trying to concurrently build more than one product, so we tried to imagine a different kind of company that could realistically develop a portfolio of market-leading products across a diverse set of market segments. We knew this company would need a nontraditional business model that could provide a perpetual source of non-dilutive capital to incubate our portfolio companies, as well as a continuous stream of new founders, top engineers and designers, and great product ideas. Hence was born our Engineering as a Service consulting business.  Above all, we knew that in order to surface the best product ideas, our company would have to be based on a unique culture that elevates innovation to a first-class citizen, alongside execution. We have created such a culture, and we continuously strive to reinforce it throughout our organization and in every aspect of leadership and management. Here's how we do it: Entrepreneurs are characterized by the risks that they take in striving to create value. Hackers are inventors  -  people who naturally defy conventional wisdom to create and improve all kinds of things. We start by hiring really smart hackers with entrepreneurship in their DNA. Hackerati are visionary, unconventional, quirky tinkerers and explorers who understand the value of creating a sustainable business. Gumption is the psychic gasoline that keeps the whole thing going. – Robert M. Pirsig Gumption is one of those words that you rarely hear people use these days, but you kind of know it when you see it. We see gumption as passion  -  caring so deeply about something so as not to overlook even the slightest detail. We encourage Hackerati to form an opinion, to articulate their reasoning and to listen as others do the same, and to tenaciously drive towards solutions so that there is no way the problem at hand could possibly go unresolved.   Sailing fast is an exercise in balancing true wind and apparent wind to move the boat in the desired direction while minimizing drag. It takes a tremendous amount of coordination to make this happen, and your course is rarely a straight line. Such is the case with innovative technology teams. Product design and engineering work in concert to move forward, utilizing just enough structure and rules to maintain coordination, but not so much as to slow the team down or to make it difficult to pivot. Integrity has no need of rules. – Albert Camus Some rules are necessary for any organization to function, but too many rules can create drag that slows down the team and stifles innovation. We try to minimize rules, relying instead on the social contracts that we establish among ourselves and the integrity on which those social contracts depend. Integrity starts with the individual: be authentic, don't try to be what others think you should be, do what you say, tell the truth, and be as transparent as possible.  Innovation is about envisioning a state in which things will be substantially improved over the status quo. It's not about just doing the same things better  -  it's about discovering new things to do. To be truly innovative, we must be willing to question  -  and ultimately relinquish  -  that which we know for sure to be true, whether it is based on a priori knowledge or empirical evidence. What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so. – Mark Twain No one knows everything or is correct all of the time, especially when innovating, which often means working in areas where we have little frame of reference or are relying only on a posteriori knowledge. Our path becomes a series of rapid experiments, leading towards our destination. To reach that destination, we must ask ourselves the hard questions  -  especially of our own entrenched positions  -  and be willing to admit when our prior conclusions are incorrect. We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down. – Kurt Vonnegut, Ray Bradbury, and others Innovation is a free fall. When we jump off of solid ground and attempt to invent the future, we often don't know how to fly. But we jump anyway, despite any fears that we might have, because we believe that we can land in one piece. We don't let what we don't know get in the way of taking action. We make decisions despite ambiguity, and we always make new mistakes. Einstein wasn't motivated by survival when he was thinking about physics.... It was entertainment to him. – Linus Torvalds We do what we do at The Hackerati not because it is imperative to our survival. We do it for the sheer joy and excitement of creating something that didn't exist until we brought it to life. This is how we roll. Our culture of innovation is our secret sauce and our competitive advantage, and it is ultimately the truest expression of who we are. We are doers and dreamers. We are students and teachers. We are scientists and artists. We are The Hackerati.
